# FOREWARD : This is a collection of interview questions that I came across while job searching for the majority of 2021. Also a collection of skills that I learned in my first few years on the job that I found super helpful. My goal for this project is to get a junior engineer up to speed quickly when they are out looking for a job. The demo files are kept small and manageable, and are meant to demonstrate 1 or 2 different skills or concepts. Feel free to play around with the files and experiment with them as you see fit. I'll try to keep adding to this project to the best of my abilities. Thank you for downloading and I hope you learn something from this.

# IMPORTANT SIDENOTE : Everything in this project will be tested thoroughly on my own system, but as in the real world I cannot guarantee that the files will work perfectly on everyone's machine. I'll do the best that I can to ensure that it works fine, but you may be forced to roll your sleeves up and fix some issues on your own. My advice to you : Googling your errors fixes half of your problems, and tracing through a file to find the point of error, coupled with a little bit of intuition, usually fixes the other half. Error logs are your friend too. Message me on GitHub and I'll try to help to the best of my abilities if you get super stuck. 
# IMPORTANT SIDENOTE : If you have any suggestions to improve this project, don't hesitate at all to reach out to me. I don't bite.

# Developed with complete beginners in mind, but hopefully some experienced engineers can take a thing or two away from this
# Will be awfully verbose, well-commented in order to accomodate beginners

// This project assumes : 
    // You're either a complete noob to software development, you're a student looking to expand your skillset, or you're an entry level engineer
    // You want to learn about embedded systems or firmware
    // You're running this on a Debian-based Linux distro, like Ubuntu or Mint
    // A basic understanding of Linux commands, but I'll do my best to step through this anyways

// Do you want to include these?

// Topics to consider
Linux kernel
Firmware
Alias?

// A good place to start?
